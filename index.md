Welcome to the GeoDa Center sandbox blog. This site intends to be an
archive for diverse snippets, functions and other useful material produced by
the GeoDa Center team. This is a **completely experimental space** so do not
expect the reliability and stability of other projects from the GeoDa Center
for Geospatial Analysis and Computation such as OpenGeoDa, GeoDaSpace or
PySAL. Also, because of its very nature, do not expect any frequency in
posting.

Check out the [archive section](http://geodasandbox.github.com/archive.html) 
to find posts that present and explain all the goodness hosted in the [GitHub
repository](http://github.com/geodasandbox/sandbox) and follow us on Twitter
([@geodacenter](http://twitter.com/geodacenter)) or Facebook
to stay tuned about new posts and new code. 

Happy hacking!!!
